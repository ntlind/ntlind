# 👋 Hey, I'm Nick

## Highlights

I'm a software engineer and data scientist based in Denver, CO. Previously, I've worked on:
- **🧮 Modeling & Evaluations @ Striveworks**: Evaluating and ranking classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation models using Python, PostGIS, Redis, and Docker.
- **🗣️ Speech AI @ Meta's Augmented Reality AI team**: Enhancing our automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language understanding (NLU), entity resolution (ER), and knowledge graph services using Python, Spark, Presto, and MySQL. 
- **📊 Owner @ Quantile**: Building custom forecasting and analytics web applications for technology and media companies using React.js, Python, Kafka, and Snowflake.
